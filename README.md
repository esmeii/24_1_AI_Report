## Overview
I am writing a report on optimizing the Job Shop Scheduling (JSS) problem using artificial intelligence algorithms. This project involves evaluating the effectiveness of various AI techniques in solving JSS, which is a critical issue in production management and combinatorial optimization.

## Algorithms

- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**
- **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)**

## Files
- **problemMaker.py**: Code for generating JSS problem instances.
- **varNS.py**: Implementation of the Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm.
- **genetic.py**: Implementation of the Genetic Algorithm.
- **annealing.py**: Implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different AI algorithms can be applied to optimize JSS problems, highlighting their comparative advantages and potential for enhancing production management.
